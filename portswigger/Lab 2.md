# Lab 2: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

## Category

Broken Access Control – Vertical Privilege Escalation

## Core Issue

Administrative functionality was exposed through a JavaScript file and accessible directly without proper server-side authorization checks.

## Attack Strategy

Reviewed client-side JavaScript to identify hidden administrative endpoints.
Accessed the discovered admin URL directly to reach privileged functionality.

## Technical Failure

Backend failed to enforce role-based access control on sensitive endpoints.
Application relied on obscurity rather than authorization validation.

## Impact (Real World Context)

## Attackers could access administrative panels and perform privileged actions such as deleting user accounts.
