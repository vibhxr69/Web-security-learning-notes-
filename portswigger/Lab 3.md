# LAB 3 — User Role Controlled by Request Parameter

## Category

Broken Access Control

Vertical Privilege Escalation

Parameter Tampering

## Vulnerability Description

The application relied on a client-controlled request parameter to determine administrative privileges. Authorization decisions were made using user-supplied data without server-side validation.

## Attack Methodology

1.Intercepted authenticated request using Burp Suite.

2.Identified privilege parameter in request.

3.Modified authorization value from: admin - false to admin - true

4.Forwarded request to server.

5.Application granted administrative access.

## Technical Root Cause

Authorization logic was implemented on the client side instead of being enforced securely on the server. The server trusted modified request parameters.

## Impact

1.Unauthorized administrative access

2.Privilege escalation

3.Ability to perform sensitive operations

## Security Recommendation

1.Implement server-side authorization checks

2.Do not trust client-supplied privilege values

3.Enforce role validation from session/database
